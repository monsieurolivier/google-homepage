The Odin Project - PROJECT: HTML/CSS

Final project of the Front End section of the Web Development 101 course of The Odin Project. The goal is to recreate Google Search homepage using acquired knowledge of HTML and CSS only. The easy way is to recreate the page without any search result. The hard part includes results. I will be doing the hard part because I want to get the most experience possible out of this challenge.
